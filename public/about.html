                        and it connects the spiritual and practical dimensions of intellectual life, in a stimulating
                        environment that fosters rigorous scholarship and supportive community. This Institute is a
                        great possession of the committed Trust called 'The Kongu Vellalar Institute of Technology
                        Trust' in Erode District, Tamilnadu. The noble Trust has taken the institute to greater heights
                        since its inception in 1983 and has established the college as a forum for imparting value based
                        education for men and women.</p>

                        state of India and the term 'Kongu Vellalar'
                        specially means the agricultural community, predominated in the west of Tamilnadu, which was
                        deprived of educational facility in those days. To achieve technical excellence in their rural
                        areas, 41 philanthropists from different walks of life who realized the need for technical
                        education for their region's economic strides, formed collectively a Trust called 'The Kongu
                        Vellalar Institute of Technology Trust' and they tried to promote and develop equality of
                        opportunity for the rich and the poor.</p>
